## FAQ

#### What do I need?
You can find the Bill of Materials (BOM) [here](https://github.com/Pouria-Mueller/OpenStatusLight/blob/main/BOM/Hardware.md).

#### Can I modify it?
Yes, modifications are welcome! Just make sure to follow the [license terms](https://github.com/Pouria-Mueller/OpenStatusLight/blob/main/LICENSE).

#### How can I contribute?

Feel free to create a new branch.  
Once you've made your changes, open a Pull Request (PR).  
I'll review it and merge if everything looks good.

  <summary>Please make sure to verify your commits using a GPG key to ensure authenticity</summary>

  I believe it's good practice to sign your commits to prevent impersonation,  
  so commit signing is **required**.

#### What platforms are supported?
Currently only Microsoft Teams but I hope I can add support for Matrix, Rocket Chat and maybe Nextcloud and Discord (I don't know about Discord yet, because of recent events), but it highly depends on the API of the platform

### Can I track the status of multiple people?
Yes! that’s actually the main reason I created it. In my workplace, I share a room with two other apprentices. Sometimes, when one of us received a call, the others didn’t notice and accidentally caused interruptions. To solve this, I designed the system to support multiple users and make everyone's status visible in one Light.
