# CAD Files

> [!NOTE]
> The Files are Designed to fit the parts listed in the BOM. If you redesign parts you need to follow the License

#### Parts are designed in FreeCAD (/design) but i also exported the .3mf file which is compatible with Slicers if you donÂ´t want to install FreeCAD (/fdm)

>[!Warning]
>The files are designed for a 0,4mm Nozzle
>I do **not** reccomend Dome mode and Variable layer hight for the dome!
